- The application front end has already been created, it's your job to build the backend and connect the two.

- The following HTML routes should be created:

  - GET `/notes` - Should return the `notes.html` file.

  - GET `*` - Should return the `index.html` file

- The application should have a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

- The following API routes should be created:

  - GET `/api/notes` - Should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

  - POST `/api/notes` - Should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.
